# SWAPIbox

## Individual: [Sabrina Kennedy](https://github.com/skenne21), 

## Description

This was an individual project to make a Star Wars facts application. A user can come to the page and get information about the people, vehicles, and planets of the Star Wars universe. Each card has a favorites button, that when clicked, will add that card to favorites which can be viewed on a separate page. Data comes from the Star Wars API:https://swapi.co/documentation.

## Goals of Project:

* Get comfortable whipping together React components on your own with the additional complexity of implementing React Router (if you want to).
* Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
* Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
* Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
* Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
* Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
* Use propTypes for every component receiving props.

## Set Up

Clone this project

Run `npm install` from the root directory

Run `npm start`

You can run the testing suite with `npm test`.


## Future

I would like to add more star Wars data in the furture, with pulling in starship information or allowing the user to see more data that comes from the api.
